# For onepane task, 

i have created a cd pipeline to build and push the image to Dockerhub.

Link of public image: [Link](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/taniaduggal60/onepane/general)

and also i changed the version of base image in Dockerfile to 1.18 as there are packages are updates regularly in this version and we don't face any compatability issues.
